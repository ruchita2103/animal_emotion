Dog Emotion Detection
Overview
The Dog Emotion Detection project is an innovative application of machine learning and computer vision techniques aimed at understanding and classifying the emotions of dogs from their images. This project has significant implications for improving human-dog interactions, advancing veterinary care, and contributing to research in animal behavior.

Understanding dog emotions can help pet owners respond better to their pets' needs, improve training methods, and potentially identify health issues early. This project leverages a rich dataset of dog images annotated with various emotional states to train and evaluate machine learning models capable of detecting these emotions accurately.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains a diverse set of images depicting dogs with various emotional expressions. The images are stored in the /kaggle/input/dog-emotions-prediction/images directory. Each image is labeled with one of several emotions, such as:

Happy
Sad
Angry
Surprised
Fearful
Disgusted
Neutral
This dataset is crucial for training, validating, and testing the machine learning models developed in this project.
